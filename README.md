This is an exploration of using RealityKit and specifically RealityView in a SwiftUI app for macOS.  This is a work in progress and has not been cleaned up or properly documented.  

My primary point of exploration is getting the 3D navigation (moving around in the 3D view) working smoothly.  Once I get that complete I will be adding a great deal more functionality to turn this into a 3D starmap application.

This will be based upon a SceneKit app that I have for the same purpose.  Check out my HitTestApp to see some of that work: https://github.com/Thunor/HitTestApp.
